# üì° Fuzzy Logic-Based Cluster Head Selection in Wireless Sensor Networks

This project introduces a dynamic, intelligent simulation for *cluster head selection* in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) using *Fuzzy Logic*. The system optimizes energy efficiency and network lifetime by evaluating node characteristics and simulating CH selection through a visual, Streamlit-based interface.

## ‚öô Key Features

- *Fuzzy-Based CH Selection:*  
  Calculates selection probability using fuzzy rules based on:
  - Residual energy  
  - Distance to base station  
  - Node density  

- *Visual WSN Deployment:*  
  Plots 30 random nodes on a 100x100 field with color-coded CH

- *Dynamic Simulation:*  
  User can select time interval and trigger simulations through UI

- *Automatic Decision Logic:*  
  Selects the most eligible node as CH using fuzzy evaluation

- *Base Station Support:*  
  Fixed BS at center coordinates (50, 50) for distance calculation
